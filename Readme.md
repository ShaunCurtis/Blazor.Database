# Blazor.Database

This is my current working Repository for developing a CRUD Database Template for Blazor.

Included in that are controls covered by specific articles on my [Personal Github Site](https://shauncurtis.github.io/) and published on various sites (*\Blazor.DataBase\Components\Controls*):

1. EditFormState
2. ValidationFormState
3. InlineDialog

You can see a working version of this site on Azure at [cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net](https://cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net/).
