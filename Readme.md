# Blazor.Database

This is my current working Repository for developing a CRUD Database Template for Blazor.

There are a set of articles associated with this Repository on my personal GitHub site - [Building a Database Application in Blazor](https://shauncurtis.github.io/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor/).

This site also includes controls and pages for other specific articles on my [Personal Github Site](https://shauncurtis.github.io/) and published on various sites

Currently these are:

1. EditFormState
2. ValidationFormState
3. InlineDialog

You can see a working version of this site on Azure at [cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net](https://cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net/).
