This repository contains the code for a base level Database Blazor Dual Site Template.

There's a working site at [https://cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net/](https://cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net/).

This includes:
1. The data service layers including different DbContexts and the use of the DbContext Factory.
2. Structuring of the data layer services to cater for WASM and Server implementations.
3. Building a single site to serve both WASM and Server SPAs.
4. Edit form implementations.
5. Building and using UI controls.
