# Blazor.Database

This code base for building Blazor Projects has been superceeded.  I've left it here because I know it still gets visitors and serveral people have starred or forked it.

The new solution is at [Blazor.Demo](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/Blazr.Demo).


==============================================================

This is no longer my current working Repository for developing a CRUD Database Template for Blazor.

There are a set of articles associated with this Repository on my personal GitHub site - [Building a Database Application in Blazor](https://shauncurtis.github.io/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor/).

You can see a working version of this site on Azure at [cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net](https://cec-blazor-database.azurewebsites.net/).
